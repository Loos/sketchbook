Bird Collision Journal
=====================

For a few years my partner and I have been monitoring birds that collide
with buildings downtown. These birds fly thousands of miles, and follow
natural land lines like the shore of Lake Michigan; that is why so many
of them crash into buildings in downtown Chicago. Once a week during
the migratory season we will go out before dawn and rescue the birds we
can. The dead are brought to the Field Museum, and the live go to
Willowbrook Wildlife Rehabilitation Center. For more information see the
[CBCM website](http://www.birdmonitors.net/).
